about: Add a direct Google Calendar sync option to the website

## Summary
The website previously had an inactive "Add to Google Calendar" button. We removed
it, but a proper integration would be useful in the future.

## Tasks
- Research official Google Calendar widgets or OAuth based solutions
- Allow users to connect their Google account and subscribe to events
- Ensure privacy and security of any authentication tokens
- Provide a graceful fallback to ICS downloads
