Well well well.The vitals:Monday, June 167:00 ~ Doors7:30 ~ First Times ~ PLEASE BABY PLEASEFirst Times Presents: Andrea Kramer's \"Please Baby Please\"- After witnessing a violent crime, Suze and her husband Arthur begin to unravel as new fears and desires take hold. Director Amanda Kramer dissects the breakdown of the \"perfect\" American couple through artifice and over-the-top theatrics, anchored by Andrea Riseborough's sizzling performance that's as intoxicating as it is unsettling. The film's visual style has been compared toWest Side Storyby way of Kenneth Anger — a refreshing departure from the realism that often dominates contemporary cinema. Lofty and poetic, Kramer has said that this film is meant to leave you with more questions than answers.-Emily Basma",

        "description": "Experience the beginning of horror's greatest soap opera.The vitals:Friday, June 277:00 ~ Doors7:30 ~ SAWLet's talk in the first-person for a second. I love SAW. I have no shame about loving SAW. What the haters and losers don't realize about SAW is that it's secretly the best longform soap opera ever released in movie theaters. Horror is a genre which constantly flirts with the idea of camp and short of something explicitly goofy like the CHUCKY films SAW may actually be the greatest modern realization of this concept. Consider Jigsaw, consider his silly voice and consider his gay little puppet and consider his relentlessly petty attitude and consider how in its best moments his philosophy amounts to pushing past fear to embrace yourself and live your true life. Consider the intense homoeroticism of two men chained in a bathroom, their lives in each other's hands, cradling each other; \"don't leave me.\" Like a weed pushing through concrete, yaoi endures.Anyway. We're screening SAW. It's the first movie so there's not a bunch of characters and flashbacks inside flashbacks yet. It's sort of like SE7EN with some TETSUO: THE IRON MAN stylistic flourishes. You already know if you want to come see this or not. Actually, you should sell this out so I can show the whole franchise. Screening SAW III in an abandoned meat packing plant? I think so. See you there.- Morgan Hyde",
