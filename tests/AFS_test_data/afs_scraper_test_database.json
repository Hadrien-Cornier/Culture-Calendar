Can he be found before unseen dangers close in? GWEN, a long-lost gem of animation, is a post-apocalyptic odyssey akin to ANGEL’S EGG — mysterious, thrilling, and utterly captivating.

This is not a straight-ahead music doc by any means but rather an often funny meditation on the meaning of music and, well, life itself. Written and directed by Alex Ross Perry (THE COLOR WHEEL, HER SMELL, LISTEN UP PHILIP.) See Pavement live on Sunday, September 28, during LEVITATION 2025 at the Palmer Events Center.

Following in the footsteps of her beloved literary heroines, Agathe discovers a bit about real life outside of books — and not just romance, either. It is a universal truth: Sometimes to unwreck your own life, you’ve got to start acting like you’re the protagonist.” —Alissa Wilkinson, New York Times (Critic’s Pick) “A celebration of bibliophilia and cinephilia alike.” —Ann Hornaday, Washington Post Agathe (Camille Rutherford) is a hopelessly clumsy yet charming young woman who works in the legendary Shakespeare & Co. bookshop in Paris. While she dreams of being a successful writer, and of experiencing love akin to a Jane Austen novel, she finds herself desperately single and plagued by writer’s block. When Agathe’s best friend (Pablo Pauly) gets her invited to the Jane Austen Writers’ Residency in England, she finally has her Jane Austen moment … and is caught in a very unexpected romantic triangle. Agathe must let go of her insecurities to decide what she really wants for herself — and to achieve her romantic and professional dreams.",

        "description": "Do you need a good laugh right now? How about fifty good laughs? It’s the 40th anniversary of one of the most charming, funny, and creative Hollywood films ever made. In 1985, Paul Reubens and his creative collaborators were just on the verge of a pop-cultural breakthrough. The Pee-Wee Herman character had become popular in talk show spots and on hip improv stages, but would it translate to the big screen? Well, we all know the answer. With the help of co-writers Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol and director Tim Burton, the precocious man-child became a household name, and provided proof of concept for a brilliant television series that followed. The film is an astonishing blast of comedic invention, carried by Reubens and ably supported by an absolutely perfect supporting cast and a music score by Danny Elfman.",

The rules are simple: never go beyond the garden walls, stay inside to be protected, and only when the DOGTOOTH falls out will the children be prepared to face the dangers of the outside world. And the biggest danger of all? Daddy. Home is where the horror begins as a father and mother exert complete control over their adult children, that is, until an outsider brought in to satisfy the needs of the eldest son brings with her the wonders of sex and VHS tapes. Dubbed “perverse”, “bizarre”, and downright “weird”, Yorgos Lanthimos’ DOGTOOTH added another label after the end credits rolled, Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language film.",
