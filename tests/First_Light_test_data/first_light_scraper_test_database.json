        "description": "Let's go to the movies. First Light heads to Austin Film Society for a screening of Crash, David Cronenberg's visceral, bizarre, and transgressive adaptation of J.G. Ballard's novel about people who are obsessed with car crashes and their aftermath. Tickets include access to the screening and conversation with author Violet Lucca on Cronenberg's work and her forthcoming monograph, DAVID CRONENBERG CLINICAL TRIALS. First Light will be selling copies of both Lucca's and Ballard's books at AFS Cinema.About the book An illustrated monograph on the work of legendary writer and director David Cronenberg, master of body horror and cinematic provocateur behind films such as The Fly, Scanners, Naked Lunch, Eastern Promises, and Crimes of the Future. Cronenberg’s films have long enjoyed a cult following, pushing the boundaries of taste, blending high art with horror, and straddling the commercial and the cutting-edge. With this handsome book, the familiar and unfamiliar aspects of iconic films such as Videodrome, The Fly, Naked Lunch, and Crash is explored.Though dividing the book into two halves suggests a binary, the Jungian-inspired chapters within each emphasize that this work—and the world itself—is perpetually shifting. The reader progresses through these different stages (of Jungian individuation and therapy) and sees how the recurrent narrative, cultural, and visual themes loop back and intersect with one another. Rather than a straightforward narrative about a filmmaker, this book is a dreamlike exploration of all that is Cronenbergian.Featuring a foreword by Oscar-nominated actor Viggo Mortensen, it also includes interviews with composer Howard Shore, production designer Carol Spier, cinematographer Peter Suschitzky, and producer and playwright/screenwriter Jeremy Thomas.About the author Violet Lucca’s writing has appeared in The New York Times, Criterion’s The Current, Art in America, The Village Voice, and elsewhere. She studied film and film production at the University of Iowa, graduating with honors, and received her master’s degree in cinema studies from New York University in 2009.Violet will be joined in conversation by Lars Nilsen, the lead programmer at AFS.",

        "description": "Join First Light Books on Tuesday, July 29, for the book launch of TELL ME WHAT YOU LIKE, Katie Simon's debut narrative nonfiction work about intimacy after sexual assault.About the bookOver a decade ago, Katie Simon began seeking out stories of people who faced sexual challenges after sexual trauma—just as she did. Simon interviewed dozens of survivors, and her investigation yielded diverse responses from people of all backgrounds, ultimately confirming that there is no single path toward healing.Simon's research led her to life-changing findings that sexual assault survivors most want to know about: coping with trauma triggers and traumatic stress symptoms such as anxiety, depression, physical pain, and flashbacks. From embodied consent to self-pleasure, sexual regret, break-ups and beyond, you'll find answers to all your questions about how sexual trauma affects sex and relationships within these pages, in stories told by survivors who've actually been there.Millions of survivors across the United States are treated as irreparably broken. Simon offers a positive approach to healing based on empathy and community—and the understanding and tools to navigate trauma and cultivate the sex lives we desire and deserve. The narratives Simon has gathered break down the potential obstacles to rebuilding post-assault, and offer multiple paths forward with optimistic, new approaches to sex after sexual assault. Packed with insights, stories, and advice, this invaluable guide reimagines what sex can look like—not only for survivors, but for all of us.About the author Katie Simon (she/they) has been published in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Vogue, BuzzFeed, The Cut, and elsewhere, including the anthology Anatomy of Silence. Katie earned a BA in contemporary storytelling at New York University and an MA in biography and creative nonfiction writing at University of East Anglia. She studied narrative medicine at Columbia University and completed the Memoir Incubator at Grub Street in Boston, Massachusetts and the Human Sexuality Intensive at the Kinsey Institute. She lives in Texas with her dog, Babka.",

Tickets include a copy of the book and a reserved seat. Unreserved seats are available on a first come, first served basis. Free RSVPs are also encouraged.About the bookIn the exhilarating spirit of Wild and A Walk in the Park, an adventure-filled memoir of one woman’s struggle to succeed as a wildland firefighter on an elite, male-dominated crew as they battle some of the fiercest wildfires in the West.When Kelly Ramsey drives over a California mountain pass to join an elite firefighting crew, she’s terrified that she won’t be able to keep up with the intense demands of the job. Not only will she be the only woman on this hotshot crew and their first in ten years, she’ll also be among the oldest. As she trains relentlessly to overcome the crew’s skepticism and gain their respect, megafires erupt across the West, posing an increasing danger both on the job and back home. In vivid prose that evokes the majesty of Northern California’s forests, Kelly takes us on the ground to see how major wildfires are fought and to lay bare the psychological toll, the bone-deep weariness, and the unbreakable camaraderie that emerge in the face of nature’s fury.Despite the wear and tear of her rookie year in fire, Kelly gears up for a second season, determined to prove that not only can a woman survive this work, she can excel. But when her plans to marry her partner start to crumble and sparks fly with a fellow crew member, Kelly wrestles with whether she’s truly outgrown the self-destructive patterns she’s learned from her father, whose drinking and itinerant ways haunt her. And as the season wears on, she discovers how tenuous “belonging” can be amid ever-changing crew dynamics.In this vivid, visceral, and intimate memoir, Kelly wrestles with the immense power of fire for both destruction and renewal, confronted with the questions: Which fires do you fight, and which do you let burn you clean?About the authorKelly Ramsey studied poetry at the University of Virginia and fiction writing at the University of Pittsburgh. She cofounded The Lighthouse Works, an artists’ residency program, and later moved to Northern California, where she worked for the US Forest Service as a trail maintenance worker, wilderness ranger, and wildland firefighter. Her writing has appeared in The Washington Post, Sierra magazine, Electric Literature, and the anthology Letter to a Stranger. She lives in Redding, California, with her partner and their dog, Rookie.",

        "description": "First Light Books welcomes County Highway to the shop—a magazine about America in the form of a 19th century newspaper. After a happy hour to mingle with your fellow newsstans, founder and editor David Samuels will be in conversation with contributing writer Meaghan Garvey.County Highway merch will be exclusively available to attendees with the purchase of an issue, or of two forthcoming titles from their new publishing imprints: Bloodline by Lee Clay Johnson and Life Sentences by Martin Mull.This event is free to attend; RSVPs are encouraged.About the publicationWherever there’s a stop sign, there’s a story.Started on a shoestring by three friends (David Samuels, Walter Kirn, and Ryan Baesemann) in the wake of the pandemic, County Highway has since become the fastest growing print periodical in the country—earning an annual circulation of 150,000 copies barely one year after releasing its debut issue. The name is inspired by what they believe is the perfect-sized place for the enhancement of life and art. A county is a chunk of earth big enough to allow for a variety of human types, but small enough to get to know a decent number of one's neighbors—where they come from, what they’re proud of, what they fear, what they smoke, what they drink, and what they love. The county where this newspaper is located is somewhere between all those places, real and imaginary. It’s the scale of the place that’s important, and also the idea of traveling from one to another with an eye towards finding new answers to the founding American questions of who we are and why we are here. County Highway features hairy off-road adventures by some of America's best and strangest writers; reports on the myriad of political and spiritual crises that are gripping our country and their deeper cultural and historical sources; regular columns about agriculture, civil liberties, animals, herbal medicine, and living off the grid, both mentally and physically; essays about literature and art; and an entire section devoted to music. Offering a roadside banquet of American humor, common-speech, and social and political insights in every issue, it prints six times each year for readers across all fifty states and Canada. About the featured guestsDavid Samuels is editor and co-founder of County Highway. He had a long career as a staff and contract writer for The New Yorker, Harper’s, The Atlantic, The New York Times Magazine, The Point, and other magazines, on subjects including dog tracks, music festivals, blimp pilots, serial impostors, jewel thieves, pigeon racing, and the art of bringing down large buildings with explosives. He also reported on wars in the Balkans and the Middle East, where he learned the importance of gun safety. He is currently restoring a gold 1985 Porsche 924 that he bought off a guy who found it in a barn. Meaghan Garvey is a writer and illustrator living on the beach in the Midwest. She’s a contributing writer to County Highway, with bylines in Pitchfork, NPR, The New York Times, New York Magazine, Tablet, and Vulture, and many other outlets. Her debut book Midwestern Death Trip will be published by Panamerica Books in 2026.",
