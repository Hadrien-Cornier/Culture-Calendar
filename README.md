## 🤖 For AI agents

Endpoints designed for agents — LLM tools, crawlers, and downstream automations. Culture Calendar publishes several machine-readable surfaces as static files on GitHub Pages; no auth, no rate limits beyond Pages defaults.

- **[`llms.txt`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/llms.txt)** — [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/)-formatted index of every page and feed on the site. Start here.
- **[`llms-full.txt`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/llms-full.txt)** — plain-text dump of the top events with HTML stripped, for reasoning over the corpus without per-event fetches.
- **[`/api/`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/api/)** — JSON aggregates: [`events.json`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/api/events.json), [`top-picks.json`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/api/top-picks.json), [`venues.json`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/api/venues.json), [`people.json`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/api/people.json), [`categories.json`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/api/categories.json). Per-event JSON at `/events/<slug>.json` mirrors the page-level JSON-LD.
- **[`.well-known/ai-agent.json`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/.well-known/ai-agent.json)** — agent manifest describing every endpoint above plus the feeds. Use as the entry point for automated discovery.
- **Feeds** — [`feed.xml`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/feed.xml) (RSS 2.0 of top picks), [`calendar.ics`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/calendar.ics) (all events, iCal), [`top-picks.ics`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/top-picks.ics) (top picks only, iCal), [`sitemap.xml`](https://hadrien-cornier.github.io/Culture-Calendar/sitemap.xml).
- **Crawler policy** — `robots.txt` explicitly allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, CCBot, Google-Extended, Meta-ExternalAgent, and Amazonbot.

### 🔧 Setup Your Own Instance

1. **Fork & Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Culture-Calendar.git
   cd Culture-Calendar
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add:
   # PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

4. **Customize Preferences**
   Edit `preferences.txt` with your favorite directors, genres, and keywords. For book club events, you can also add classic authors in `literature_preferences.txt`.

5. **Enable GitHub Pages & Actions**
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Set source to "main branch /docs folder"
   - Go to Settings > Actions > General  
   - Enable "Read and write permissions"
   - Add `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` to repository secrets

6. **Install Node Dependencies & Index with GitNexus** _(optional, for AI code intelligence)_
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run analyze
   # Output: 781 nodes | 1,928 edges | 56 clusters | 63 flows

   # Generate wiki (requires OPENAI_API_KEY or GITNEXUS_API_KEY):
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   npm run wiki
   ```
   > **Note**: Do not use `npx gitnexus` — it fails on Node v24. Use `npm run analyze` instead.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Website not loading**: Check GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- **No calendar data**: Verify GitHub Actions have repository write permissions  
- **API errors**: Ensure `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is added to repository secrets
- **Missing events**: AFS website structure may have changed (check scraper.py)

### GitHub Actions Issues
- **403 Permission Error**: Enable "Read and write permissions" in Settings > Actions
- **Workflow not running**: Check cron schedule and repository activity requirements
- **API rate limiting**: Built-in delays handle this automatically

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Test locally with debug output
source venv/bin/activate  
python main.py --debug
```
